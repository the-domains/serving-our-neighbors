Transforming Cities, Transforming Nations! 

Since 1999, Serving Our Neighbors been Collaborating Leaders to Change Their World (Mission) by Mobilizing Strategic Prayer & Service (Purpose) That All May Know Him (Vision).

Serving Our Neighbors (SON) is an initiative of Community, Marketplace & Faith-Based Leaders working together to mobilize Strategic Transformation of the Major Spheres of Influence that Shape & Control our Society & Culture (Family, Faith, Business, Government, Education, Media & Entertainment) and Those Who Have No Voice (Unborn, Orphans/Widows, Jobless/Homeless, Elderly/Disabled, Imprisoned, New Immigrants & Addicted/Trafficked).

As our
SON logo illustrates, together, we are Serving Our Neighbors by 
encouraging all Believers to start with strategic Prayer (Vertical 
Agreement in what God wants for our Neighbors, Classmates & WorkLife
Associates), followed by intentional Care (Horizontal Agreement in what
God has shown us to do for them in our Neighborhood, School & 
WorkLife), followed by a targeted Share (via Planting Seeds of Hope in 
their hearts and minds when asked to share our Faith in Him).

SON is about Helping You Connect, Educate & Engage with other Believers for Prayer & Service throughout the Greater Portland / Vancouver metro area, because it's time for us to "get out of the salt shaker" and into our communities! It's time for us to "Just Show Up" and "Get More Involved" in the lives of those that don't know Him! 

"It's Time for Convergence - for Believers to grow up into the Calling, Career, Creativity & Community that God has designed
for them to be! For us to Connect, Educate & Engage in more Prayer
& more Service, so that those that don't know Him will experience 
His Presence, His Blessing & His Love in every aspect of their 
lives" - James Autry, Executive Director
